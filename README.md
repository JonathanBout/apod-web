# apod-web

April 1st 2022 beginner programmer me pushed this to GitHub: [JonathanBout/NASAImages](https://github.com/JonathanBout/NASAImages). In 2023 I came back to do some bugfixes and performance improvements. But come on, it was written with Windows Forms. Who does that nowadays!?

That's why I decided to rewrite it as a web app. Faster, multi-platform and most important: dark theme!
